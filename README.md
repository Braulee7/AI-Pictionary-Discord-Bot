drawing their prompts, a player is asked to provide a prompt to the bot and the 
bot then creates an image from the prompt and asks the remaining players to guess.

#NOTICE
This projects uses AI generation of images so I want to remind anyone who wants to 
recreate or build on this project to respect artists and their work. Openai wants 
everyone to use ethically sourced images in their training and I wish everyone who 
works with this AI to do the same.
